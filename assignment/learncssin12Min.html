               <p>Drupal boasts The White House and The Economist as users, whereas WordPress has The New York Times and CNN. Because of the varying benefits already discussed, WordPress is the obvious choice for creative websites and publishing content, and Drupal is good for those who need a stable and scalable website without prioritizing aesthetics. </p>
               <p>For instance, if you're a creative agency, you’ll want to project your unique designs, so Drupal might be your choice. Drupal comes in at the top again if you hold lots of data for your own company or clients, since security will be a top priority. And if SEO is part of your marketing strategy, Drupal will work best because of its ability to handle lots of content and provide a quick page load. </p>
               <p>
              If you want to create a multi-author publishing platform, you’ll be better off with WordPress. Just make sure you’ve estimated how big your site will become, as Drupal can handle larger sites better. It’s possible to switch later once you’ve grown, but it’s obviously simpler not to.
              The main factor – and it’s a big one – is the ease of use. If you don’t have the experience to develop your own website, or don’t have the time or money to pay someone else to, WordPress is the option for you. You can basically ignore the extra features of Drupal!</p>
              <p>
              Drupal was designed with developers in mind and so the design possibilities are endless. Developers are actively encouraged to come up with their own solutions. But this developer-friendly aspect is intimidating for the lay-man, and so it’s a strength and a weakness at the same time.</p>
